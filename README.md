## 🚀 What is Rhombus?

**Rhombus** is a self-reliant AI organization founded by a 16-year-old, Akshit, with a mission to **learn by building, and build by inventing.**  
We don’t wait for tools — we make our own.  
We don’t just fine-tune — we research and train models from scratch.

Rhombus is built to be like Iron Man’s lab — anything we need, we build ourselves.  
It is also inspired by how OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic evolved — but designed to be faster, leaner, and smarter using agents and custom toolchains.

## 🧱 How Rhombus Works

Rhombus operates using a **3-Column Strategy** — each division supports the others.

### 🔹 1. Finetune & Learn
> Finetune existing models to learn, test datasets, evaluate tools.
- Example: Karta-125M, SmolLM experiments
- Purpose: Validate dataset quality, learn training tricks

### 🔹 2. Build In-House Models
> Build models completely from scratch using public/custom data.
- Example: Water v0.2, Kishor v2, Klaa Mk2
- Purpose: Move from user to creator

### 🔹 3. Research & Invent
> Research and develop new training methods, architectures, tools.
- Example: Brahma Architecture, Token Scheduler, Edge-Efficient Models
- Purpose: Push AI beyond limits — lightweight, fast, smart models

## 🛠️ Core Tools in Development

Every project at Rhombus is powered by **internal tools** to avoid outside dependencies.

| Tool            | Description                                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 `DataMancer`   | Dataset scraper, cleaner, formatter, deduplicator             |
| 🛠 `ModelSmith`   | Architecture builder + training loop generator                |
| 📊 `LogForge`     | Logs training stats (loss, accuracy, perplexity) with CLI     |
| 📦 `ServeX`       | Deployment engine (Ollama, HuggingFace, local APIs)           |
| 🧰 `RhombusUtils` | Tokenizer builder, JSONL tools, metric calculators            |
| 🤖 `RhombusAgent` | Automation agents for scraping, coding, testing               |

These tools are reusable across every project.  
They are the engine of Rhombus.

## 📌 Goals of Rhombus

- ✅ Build our own LLMs, image models, and agents
- ✅ Create an efficient architecture better than Transformers (Brahma)
- ✅ Design models that work on minimal compute (mobile, CPU, 4GB GPU)
- ✅ Build everything using our own tools — from tokenizer to inference
- ✅ Release high-quality open-source tools and models
- ✅ Eventually publish papers or tools worthy of global research interest
- ✅ Use Rhombus to enter MIT, change the world

## 📚 For Contributors (in future)

We welcome contributors who want to:
- Help build lightweight and efficient AI models
- Work on real research — not just hugging other models
- Automate training, scraping, and coding tasks
- Explore architectures beyond Transformers

Stay tuned for our `CONTRIBUTING.md`, tasks, and agent APIs.

## ✨ Final Note

Rhombus is not just an organization.  
It’s an **ecosystem**, a **mission**, and a **future research empire**.  
Everything we need — we will build. And everything we build — we will share.

Welcome to the world of Rhombus. 🔺
